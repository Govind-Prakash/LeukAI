# LeukAI
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a silent killer, with a mortality rate exceeding 90% in individuals diagnosed after the age of 65. Its stealth lies in the lack of early symptoms, striking only when acute complications from bone marrow failure arise. This late detection leaves little room for effective intervention.

Predicting the onset of leukemia is not a novel endeavor; however, recent advancements in sequencing technologies have enabled the analysis of long RNA stretches, shedding light on the critical role of lncRNA in AML. Coupled with breakthroughs in deep learning and AI, these innovations provide a unique opportunity to enhance predictive models. Our approach stands out by leveraging the interdisciplinary strength of our team, combining systems biology with AI to develop a robust predictive model. By integrating the role of lncRNA into our framework, we aim to address existing gaps in the market and offer a novel, differentiated solution.
